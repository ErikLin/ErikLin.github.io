            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The package research tool provides a central place for the customer support team to track packages
                and get a complete view of a package details.

            <ul>
                <li>“Where is my package?” is the number one support request from clients.</li>
                <li>The team had 5+ systems for finding various tracking information that were painfully slow and difficult to use.</li>
                <li>Many requests are for anywhere from 1 to 100,000 packages at a time.</li>
                <li>The customer support team has to be careful about how much information can be revealed to clients, because they use two levels of tracking detail and the extra information can often confuse clients.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>A centralized place to track packages.</li>
                <li>Ability to track packages up and down the container hierarchy (BOL > container > package).</li>
                <li>Summary of large data sets containing tracking results.</li>
                <li>Provide the support team with the information clients are seeing and the extra details available to internal teams.</li>
                <li>Simplified method to share results with client</li>

            <h2>Working Through Each Design Challenge</h2>
            <h3>Viewing tracking events and Their details</h3>
            <p>
                The latest tracking status is the most important information, but it's not always trustworthy. Clients are often asking about the package because the current status is different than their expectation. As a result the support team often has to look into past events and cross reference multiple sources to determine if the latest event is trustworthy .
                <br>
                To fully understand the problem users often ask themselves the following questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>When did the event happen?</li>
                <li>Where was the package?</li>
                <li>Who had custody of the package at the time?</li>
                <li>Is the event a problem? If so, what kind of problem?</li>
                <li>How was the event triggered? Was it a physical scan of the package?</li>
                <li>What container was the package in at the time?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                That's a lot of data to distill into one view, and it wasn't immediately clear how important
                some of it was. In times of uncertainty the best thing to do is ask the users. I created a few
                different concepts and presented them to users to help choose a direction. After talking to the users I better understood their hierarchy of needs, which the timeline concept best addressed.

            <h3>Tracking THOUSANDS of packages at once</h3>
            <p>
                Often times clients would send lists of packages where only 10% of them had any issues. Most of the
                time they were just looking for a status update. The customer support team needed a tool to help
                them weed though the noise and track down problems. Their previous methods used Excel to
                filter and create pivot tables. Our goal was to automate as much as possible.

            <p>
                Identifying problems with tracking was the most important thing for users. This can come in many
                forms and often requires cross referencing several data points. The package details page was
                designed to make issues obvious at a glance.
